    <h1>Hello Github World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Danny Diaz and welcome to my GitHub Page. I recently started programming in Python and
        decided to begin establishing an online presence. I am fairly new to
        web development and HTML so my site is pretty plain. However, this will
        change in the near future and my site will become colorful and aesthetic.<br/><br/>

        My plan for 2018 is to groom my web development and data science skills. I plan on completing numerous projects
        and I will continuously add my work to this page.<br/><br/>

        If anyone would like to reach me feel free to email me at danny.jesus.diaz.94@gmail.com.<br/><br/>
