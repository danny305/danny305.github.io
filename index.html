    <h1>Hello Github World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Danny Diaz and welcome to my GitHub Page. I recently started programming in Python and
        decided to begin establishing an online presence. I am fairly new to
        web development and HTML so my site is pretty plain. However, this will
        change in the near future and my site will become colorful and aesthetic.

        My plan for 2018 is to groom my web development and data science skills. I plan on completing numerous projects
        and I will continuously add my work to this page.

        If anyone would like to reach me feel free to email me at danny.jesus.diaz.94@gmail.com.
